# Security Baseline

Step 1 contains no credentials and no backend connection. The following are implementation contracts for later steps.

## Required controls

- Enable RLS on every user-data table.
- Keep provider-verification and report-evidence buckets private.
- Use short-lived signed URLs for sensitive files.
- Never put `service_role` in Flutter. The app may only receive `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
- Reveal full address/contact data only to the customer, admin, or accepted provider.
- Require `verification_status = approved` before bidding.
- Enforce suspended-account checks server-side.
- Use transactional RPCs for `accept_bid`, `start_job`, `complete_job`, and `cancel_job`.
- Record transitions in `job_events`.
- Limit image type, size, count, and dimensions; remove EXIF/GPS metadata where possible.

## Environment contract

Mobile: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `APP_ENV=development` (not used in this round).

Admin browser: public Supabase values only. A service-role key, if later needed, belongs exclusively in a server environment and is never exposed to the client bundle.

Edge functions: FCM service credentials only in managed server secrets.
